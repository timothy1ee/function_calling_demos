# Demos for Function Calling

This repository contains a series of demos for manually implementing function calling. The milestones are described in the project here: https://hackmd.io/@timothy1ee/Hk1jhHCaA

To run each milestone, use the following command:

```bash
chainlit run milestone_<number>.py -w
```

## Installation

### 1. Create a virtual environment

First, create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

### 2. Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:
  ```bash
  .venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On macOS and Linux:
  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install dependencies

Install the project dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Updating dependencies

If you need to update the project dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Update the `requirements.in` file with the new package or version.

2. Install `pip-tools` if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install pip-tools
   ```

3. Compile the new `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip-compile requirements.in
   ```

4. Install the updated dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

This process ensures that all dependencies are properly resolved and pinned to specific versions for reproducibility.
